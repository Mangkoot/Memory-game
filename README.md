## Instructions

This is a memory card game that is part of Udacity's FEND (Front End Web Developer) nanodegree project.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. 
You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. 
This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

Just me, in addition to pre-entered code from Udacity :)

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
